	<h2><u>Day 0: First Adventure:</u></h2>
	<h4>Going into the Body, August 23rd, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs" >
		This is it. My first Adventure. I have always wanted to do this. Going deep into the human body was what I was destined to do. I have planned this out for years and even of though it is illegal and the government may realize I stole equipment from Star Labs, it has to be worth it. I need to find the answer to what is the meaning of a cone cell. If I found the answer, I would be crowned Cone Cell Master. I told Gerry the Platypus to flip the Quantum Tunnel switch on so that I can go into the body of Sachin Tendulkur. I shrunk down to a molecular level and entered his blood stream. I had a mini map on my wrist and I had a path that led me straight to the back of the eye where the Retina was. Following the bloodstream and up into the brian was very difficult since it all happened so fast. Also, going through the Neuron Signals and finding the correct one was impossible. Just like finding a needle in a haystack. As I travelled through the Neuron, I started to wonder how complex we were and how our creators must have thought about how complex we were. Finally, I entered the Cell at the Synaptic Terminal where I was greeted by nothing. I quickly figured out that time works differently around here, so I quickly jot down some notes, and hit the hay right in the middle of the highway.

	<h2><u>Day 1: Nucleus Time:</u></h2>
	<h4>Going into the Nucleus, August 25th, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		As the Rays of the Neurons fell on my Eyes, I woke up from the dreadful sleep I had. My dream was one of the scariest dreams that could ever happen for me. The dream took place November 14th 2019 at 2:00 pm. I was presenting my boring website I made in Biology and I realized I failed at the creativity aspect. Anyway, I got up and looked all around me and saw lots of organelles that were miles away from each other. The first organelle I was able to see was the Nucleus. I decided to dive down inside and examine the Nucleus. I turned my shrink ray down more and I dove into the big Nucleus. Then, I jumped. I kept falling and falling into the abyss and all around me, I found tons of nucleotides and strands of it all around me. They looked like they were working together to help out the cell. Also in the Nucleus, I found information about color and pigments which was a major surprise to me. Finally, I sent out my Charmander Drones I made to gather information where I could not go to. All they found though we're just more base pairs of different DNA Bases. Then, I blacked out.

	<h2><u>Day 2: Mighty Mitochondria Time:</u></h2>
	<h4>Going into the Mitochondria, August 27th, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		Oh boy. I woke up to the crack of down where my pet Remy the Rat started talking and saying Ratatouille over and over again. I pushed the rat in my bag, and continued my exploration. Now, it was Mitochondria time. I walked to the left side of the cell and found myself right in front of 2 or 3 red ovals which I knew had to be the Mitochondria. Outside of it, I saw energy flowing and looking really electrically. As we know, the main function of the Mitochondria is to provide energy like a powerhouse for the cell. But, 19 years back, we found out that in a Cone Cell, they have another purpose as well. I launched my Pikachu Drones this time to read the electrical data while I go exploring inside of the Mitochondria. When I jumped in, the first thing I saw was highways of information all around the organelle. I then realized that the Mitochondria was sorting out the information gathered in the Outer Segment! I checked my watch and saw that my time was almost over for the day so I collected my Pikachu Drones, and slept in between the Mitochondrias.

	<h2><u>Day 3: Into the Outer Segment:</u></h2>
	<h4>Going into the Mitochondria, August 29th, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		""Lennie begged, "Let's do it now. Le's get that place now." "Sure, right now. I gotta. We gotta."And George raised the gun and steadied it, and he brought the muzzle of it close to the back of Lennie's head. The hand shook violently, but his face set and his hand steadied. He pulled the trigger."" I just finished reading this part in Of Mice and Men because I honestly think it is the most interesting part of the book. Now, for the adventure. I finished exploring the Inner Segment of the Cone Cell and jot down some notes such as the Nucleus also stores information, the Mitochondria sorts out information, and Neurons connected the Cell to the Brain. The Outer and Inner Segment were connected by this short string called Cilia. This was just used to connect and send information from either segments to each other. Without the Cilia, the Outer and Inner Segments would not be able to Communicate. Even though the Cilia was short, as a small human, it felt long, so I'll leave the rest of the Outer Segment in the other Blog. Bye!

	<h2><u>Day 4: Outer Segment Deep Investigation:</u></h2>
	<h4>Outer Segment, August 31st, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		I will spare you Generation Z readers the intro, so let's just get to it. At first sight, I realized that the Outer Segment has thousands of Membrane Disks that hold pigments which we humans underestimated. I saw that as I progressed, the Membrane Disks kept on getting smaller and smaller and forming some sort of Cone. I saw Red, Green, and Blue pigments on these Membrane Disks which made me think how I used RGB Values for the CSS for these Journal Entries. These pigments were able to receive the colors and transform them into values only using RGB. That is fantastic! Nothing much was happening in the Outer Segment, just some Membrane Disks that had Pigments and shaped like a Cone to detect Colors. See you in my next entry.

	<h2><u>Day 5: The End:</u></h2>
	<h4>The End, August 33rd, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		As I exited the Outer Segment and got on my mini Dune Buggy to drive to the Synaptic Terminal, which sends out all the information to the brain through Neuron, I realized something. I forgot to mention so many things. While travelling through the Synaptic Terminal, I slowed down time using the Time Stone from Dr. Strange, and I realized some interesting facts. The Cone and Rod cells form a Gap Junction in which small molecules could pass through which was fantastic. Also, I realized that the Cone Cell was part of the Retina which was the Tissue in the ORgan which was the Eye. Even though I am a Robotic Engineer, I just realized that the Eye is an ORGAN!!! WOW! The Eye was connected to the Nervous System or the Sensory System part of the Nervous System. See you at the Awarding Ceremony!

	<h2><u>Day 6: Key Facts:</u></h2>
	<h4>Last Entry, August 35th, 2034</h4>
	<p class="blogs">
		I was crowned Cone Cell Master for 1 hour because then, I got arrested from stealing from Star Labs. I knew I should've just stayed down at that Cone Cell. The Cone Cell shape was shaped like a Rod and Cone on top of each other. I think that the reason for this is to allow as many Cone and Rod cells to fit in the Retina. The Arrangements of the Organelles were strategically places because the Outer Segment gets all the information, and then it goes through all the Organelles and keeps flowing down to the Synaptic Terminal for departure to the Brain by Neurons. Also, I forgot to mention this, the protein in the cell was the Homeobox Protein. This protein was able to detect light and mature photoreceptor cells into 2 types: Cone and Rod Cells. Also, this Homeobox Protein was found in the DNA and controlled some of the activity in the Genes. Lastly, here are some facts that I know you Generation Z's will love.

		<h2><u>Background Info:</u></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Cone Cell is found in the eye and is used as <strong>color receptors</strong> which detects color and sends it to your brain.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					They are also called <strong>photoreceptor cells</strong> because of their function to  detect light and color.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The Cone Cell also <strong>works together with the Rod Cell</strong>, which detects light such as black and white, to send out viable information to the brain.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2><u>Structure & Function:</u></h2>
    	<p>
			<ul>
        		<li>
			        Shaped like a rod with a cone at the end in order to <strong>capture the maximum amount of light possible.</strong>
				</li>
		        &nbsp;
		        <li>
					Made up of <strong>2 Different Parts:</strong> Inner Segment and Outer Segment.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					<strong>Outer Segment</strong> is pointed to the back and contains the Membrane Disks. These Membrane Disks are used to form a cone. Also the disks have Red, Green, and Blue pigments that detect color.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Also, a small wire shape called the <strong>Cilia</strong> connects the Inner and Outer segments.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					<strong>Inner Segment</strong> holds all the important organelles.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					<strong>Mitochondria</strong> is located in the Inner Segment which sorts out all the information given from the Membrane Discs in the Cone part.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The <strong>Nucleus</strong> stores all the information and gives it to the Synaptic Terminal.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The <strong>Synaptic Terminal</strong> then sends the information given by the Nucleus to the Neurons in the brain so the brain realizes the colors that are seen.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Arranged in a way so that the information from the Outer Segment can flow smoothly towards the Synaptic Terminal while other Organelles process the information.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					All these different functions of the Organelles work together for the main function which is to sense color.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2><u>Protein Involved:</u></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The protein that aids in the function of the Cone Cell is the <strong>Homeobox Protein.</strong>
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					This protein is found in the <strong>Retina</strong> or the light-sensitive tissue at the back of your eyes where the Cone Cell is.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					It binds to the DNA in the Nucleus to <strong>control the activity in the genes.</strong>
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Main function is the <strong>development of light detecting cells,</strong> Cone and Rod Cells, called photoreceptors.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Helps <strong>mature photoreceptor cells </strong>into either rod or cone cell and  <strong> maintain these cells</strong><strong> while preserving our vision.</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>

		</p>
		<h2><u>Junction:</u></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The Junction in between Cone Cells and Rod Cells are called <strong>Gap Juctions.</strong>
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Gap Junctions allow <strong>for more molecular communication</strong> between the Cone and Rod Cells.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					<strong>Smaller ions and molecules</strong> can pass through in a Gap Junction.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The main function of a Gap Junction in the retina is not known.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h2><u>Hierarchical Order:</u></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The first order is the <strong>Cone Cell to the Retina</strong> which is the tissue where a lot of cells are. Cell to Tissue relationship.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The second order is the <strong>Retina to the Eye</strong> which is one of the most important organs we have. Tissue to Organ relationship.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The last order is the <strong>Eye to the Nervous System or the Sensory System</strong> part which is responsible for all your 5 senses. Organ to Organ System relationship.
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h2><u>Fun Facts:</u></h2>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Your eyes focus on 50 different objects every second.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					The only organ more complex than the eye is the brain.
				</li>
				<img src="Pictures/Fact1.png" alt="Pic">
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Your eyes can distinguish approximately 10 million different colors.
				</li>
				<img src="Pictures/ok.jpg" alt="Pic" >
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					It is impossible to sneeze with your eyes open.
				</li>
				&nbsp;
				<li>
					Ommatophobia is a fear of the eyes.
				</li>
